Hello, my name name is Tom. I did have a problem, but now only emptiness is left. I loved her. We dreamed of a life, not caught in darkness. The life we deserved. It could not be. She always seemed so fair, so honest with her deep eyes. It could not be. She loved. I was so certain, but now I do not know anymore who she loved. I like to believe it was me. It was not. That is what a clear mind would say. She loved the image of me. The image she put on me. If it does not fit. The love is gone. If it does not fit one has to find a solution. Make it fit or find someone who does fit. If it does not fit, she is gone. It could not be.
